### Notes
This update introduces:
- Saved messages
- Grouped media
- Other changes

#### Saved Messages
aka Cloud Storage, aka Chat with yourself

`messageFwdHeader` now has `saved_from_peer` and `saved_from_msg_id` fields, so going to original message is now possible not just for channel posts but for any message if it was forwarded to `self`.

#### Grouped media
`message` now has `grouped_id`.
`messages.forwardMessages` now has flag `grouped`, which makes server to make forwarded messages grouped.

New method `messages.sendMultiMedia` was added, which has `multi_media:Vector<InputSingleMedia>`.
Btw, it used to have `grouped_id:flags.8?long` at first, but now `grouped_id` is generated by server in any case.
`inputSingleMedia` is just `InputMedia` + `random_id`.

Also, unlike previous way (See previous versions of this file), `sendMultiMedia` only accepts photos and videos. Not even gifs?!

If two messages have same `grouped_id`, are one after another, have same `from` and contain video/photo, they'll be rendered in mosaic or visually grouped in some other way.

#### Other
- `channel` now has optional `participants_count`. It's known to exist in search results.
- `inputMediaUploadedDocument` now has flag `nosound_video`
